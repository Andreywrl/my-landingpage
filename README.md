# 👨‍💻 The first code line
This is my first project, and the first published on GitHub too. It's the synthesis of the courses I've done in 2021.
It's a simple landing page, where you can find informations about me, my skills and my professional story.

## 🚀 Techniques
I decided to use CSS3 techniques, like "hover" on images, combining with the correct semantic of HTML5 and the interactivity of JavaScript (at this moment, only URL calls).

## 📜 Feedback
At first sight, it seemed to be very complicated, because I was not used to develop my own applications. I thank Gustavo Guanabara, from [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/), for sharing his rich content for everyone who wants to learn developing on internet.  

## 🤔 How I would improve it
Today, with my current knowledge, I would refactor the code and make it all different. I would develop it with ReactJS, aplying Material UI components and better 
responsiveness. Also, I would create an array of objects with title, images URL and description of each section. At the end, I would use array.map( ) to return the component of these informations.
